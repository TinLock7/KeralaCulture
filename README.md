The aim of this project is to map places of cultural importance using the tools available in QGIS3. We also intend to use Natural Earth Quickstart Kit for vector data and other online resources for location data. We chose to map these cultural places over Kerala as it is considered as “God's own country” due to the presence of multiple cultural heritages across the state.

The map is available at tinlock7.github.io/KeralaCulture/
